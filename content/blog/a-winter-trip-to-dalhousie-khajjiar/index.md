Every winter, images of snow clad Himalayan towns splashed my social media feed - people sipping hot beverage inside a dimly lit Café, snow covered porches and tress, furry four legged animals wandering a white landscape and other perfect pictures. So, when my friend invited me and my husband to her weekend marriage at Jammu in February, I could not resist. My plan was to club two more days with the weekend and visit at least one Himalayan town in the peak of winter. Initially I wanted to explore to Srinagar, but the tricky condition of the Banihal Pass dissuaded me from doing so. I settled on Dalhousie and Khajjiar. Since our to and fro flights were from Jammu, we travelled from Jammu to Pathankot to Dalhousie and traced the same route back.  
We took an interstate bus from Jammu to Pathankot. It took almost 2 hours. From Pathankot bus stand, we took a bus to Dalhousie. Buses from Pathankot are at regular interval, however its travel time to Dalhousie highly fluctuates. Our bus started at around 10 am and we reached Dalhousie at around 1.30 pm. We were dropped off at Subhas chowk. Since it was off season, we had no prior hotel booking. We walked towards Hotel Geetanjali, since it was a budget HPTDC guest house and got rooms with 10% discount.  
The Taxi Association office is just in front of the bus stand. As it was winter Kalatop Sanctuary, Dainkund peak, Ganji pahadi and other popular spots were closed. We checked in the charges of day trips in and around Dalhousie and were quoted an exorbitant amount. Finally, the caretaker from our hotel fixed up a cab at less than half the quoted cost and ironically, we had already met him at the Taxi Association Office! He picked us up at 3 pm and dropped us at the snow point. It was a sloping meadow covered in snow. There were hardly 3 people except us. We walked around and made a snowman before retuning.

We were dropped off at Gandhi chowk at around 5.30 pm. We found an under-construction roof watched the magnificent the Pir Panjal range during sunset. Soon it was getting dark and colder. We went inside the St. John’s Church gate, and were greeted by a pack of friendly dogs. The church was closed. We took a few snaps, played with the dogs and then strolled around Gandhi chowk and along the market. Since most shops remain closed during winter, we could not try Tibetan or any other local specialty. We tried the hot gulab jamun and gajar halwa at the chowk which were delicious, and momos. The non-veg items at the market however were a disappointment. Shops started closing at around 7.30 pm. We called it a day and walked back to the hotel where we had our dinner, which again was delicious.  
Next day we travelled to Khajjiar via Chamba which amounted to around 80 km. The shorter route via Kalatop of around 25 km remains closed all winter. On way to Khajjiar, we got a view of the Chamera dam on Ravi river and Mt. Kailash of the Dhauladhar range (not to be confused with Mt. Kailash of Kailash range). We started at 7 am and reached Khajjiar at around 10 am.  
Nestled amidst thick pine forest, Khajjiar was a beauty to behold. Khajjiar does not boast of ‘sites’ or ‘spots’. The few spots in Khajjiar, like the Khajji Nag temple, the lake etc. fall within a range of 2 - 3 km top around the meadow. If you prefer a place with view-points, bustling night market and parks for children, then a day trip to Khajjiar will suffice. However, if you like walking in silence on narrow paths surrounded by trees or lazing in a meadow with sun on your back or staring at vast pine forests, Khajjiar is your type of place and you should spend at least one night there. The natural environment has a Mc Leodgunj vibe minus the hustle and bustle.

After reaching Khajjiar, we had paranthas for breakfast at a local shop. We walked around the meadow, taking snaps for around 3 hours before heading back. Due to lack of time we had to return to Dalhousie the same day and that was a heartbreak. We had a sumptuous lunch at ____  near rock garden. We were dropped off near Subhash Chowk in Dalhousie. Since we had the afternoon off, our driver suggested us to walk up towards Dehradoon Public School school by following the big Indian flag. He said we would like the place and he was right. As the schools were closed, the place was quiet and tranquil. We found a snow-covered trail, tricky at patches and made all the way up to the flag. The view was not great, but good enough to see the town. We played in the snow for a while, made snow angels and had a snow-fight till the sun set, then walked back to our hotel.

Next day at around 6 am we started for Pathankot by car and from there to Jammu by interstate bus. And that was the end of our journey.
